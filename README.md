Nettle crypto library for Unikraft
=============================

This is the port of Nettle crypto library for Unikraft as external library.
It requires newlibc to work. When adding the library in the dependencies list,
the libraries should be like this:
`...$(UK_LIBS)/nettle:$(UK_LIBS)/newlib:...`

Please refer to the `README.md` as well as the documentation in the `doc/`
subdirectory of the main unikraft repository.
